# Lunar-Rovers-Simulated-by-Multicast-IP
Implemented a distance-vector routing protocol called RIPv2 in which a simulation of rovers executes RIP to exchange routing information with its neighbors and based on this, the rover computes the shortest path from itself to all other rovers and landers. Integrated Active RIP, Incoming routing messages, CIDR, and Route message broadcasts.
